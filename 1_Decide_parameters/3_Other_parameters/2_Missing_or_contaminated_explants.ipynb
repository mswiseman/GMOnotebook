    "However, this model has only been trained for poplar explants and only works when 12 explants are arranged according to a specific grid pattern. There are several cases in which the user should instead manually provide a spreadsheet indicating missing/contaminated explants. For example, this data should be provided manually if studying a plant other than poplar, or if using a different grid template (e.g. our standard template for 20 explants).\n",
